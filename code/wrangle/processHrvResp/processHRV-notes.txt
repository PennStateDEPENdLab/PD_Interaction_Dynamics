processHRV notes

4-Dec-2006 comparison of RSA from AcqKnowledge and processHRV

TRECALL_102_INTERROG_0014.acq

processHRV gives rsa = 5.791 with skipped beat and 5.737 corrected ~827sec of data

Do FFT and follow instructions to convert to ms^2/Hz and compute integral 0.15-0.40 Hz

value was 206.009 ms^2 and rsa = ln(206.009) = 5.328

The slight difference may be due to the fact that AcqKnowledge is taking the FFT of a 
square wave representing the R-R interval whereas processHRV is using a spline fit to the 
data.
